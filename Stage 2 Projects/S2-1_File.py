# Lesson 2.1: Introduction to Serious Programming

# Programming is grounded in arithmetic, so it's important
# to know how programming languages do simple math.
# Thankfully, Python follows the same math rules people do.
# See if you can predict the output of this code.

print 3
print 1 + 1

# My work from Lesson 2.1

print 52 * 3 + 12 * 9
print (52 * 3) + (12 * 9)
print 52 * (3 + 12) * 9
print 365 * 24 * 60 * 60

# Write a Python program that prints out the number of minutes in seven weeks.

print 7 * 7 * 24 * 60

# Write Python code to print out how far light travels
# in centimeter in one nanosecond.  Use the values
# defined below.
# speed_of_light = 299792458 meters per second
# centimeters = 100 (one meter is 100 centimeters)
# nanosecond = 1.0/1000000000 (one billionth of a second)

print 1.0/1000000000 * (299792458 * 100)
