                </header>
                <p>Computer Science attempts to solve problems by breaking them into smaller pieces and then precisely and mechanically identifying the steps to solve each piece.  These are then executed by a computer.</p>

                    <h3>Computers and Computer Programs</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Computers can't do anything without a program, but can be programmed to do any computation.  Programs tell computers what tasks to perform and in what order to perform them. </p>
                <p>Programs represent a precise sequence of steps for the computer to follow.  Computations (tasks) are performed by the computer at each step until all steps have been satisfied.</p>
                <p>Interpreters are programs that the computer uses to interpret the language used by other programs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interpreters are specific to languages (like Python).</li>
                    <li>The interpreter follows the instructions in your code.</li>
                    <li>It does that by following the instructions in it's code.</li>
                    <li>All of this can be run using your web browser.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Natural Language Ambiguity</h3>
                </header>
                <p>We can't use spoken languages like English to write computer programs due to Natural Language Ambiguity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many people can interpret the same language different ways.</li>
                    <li>Computers need a single interpretation.</li>
                    <li>Verbosity - Too many words.</li>
                    <li>Computers need efficient language.</li>
                    <li>Computer languages have unique grammer.</li>
                    <li>The logic of languages is based on Backus Naur Form.</li>
                </ul>
